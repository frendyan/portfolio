# Portfolio
This repository is to show my Data Analytics &amp; Engineering skills, share projects, and track my progress.

### [Kafka Streaming Data Pipeline](https://github.com/frendyan/kafka-streaming-data-pipeline)
A real-time data streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL, designed to showcase data engineering skills. The project simulates user activity events (page views, clicks, purchases), streams them through Kafka, and persists them in a PostgreSQL database for analysis.

### [FlexETL: Schema Evolution Pipeline](https://github.com/frendyan/schema-evolution-pipeline)
A dynamic ETL pipeline built using Apache Airflow and PostgreSQL, designed to handle schema evolution. The project extracts data from JSON files, dynamically updates the database schema to accommodate new columns, and loads transformed data into a PostgreSQL database. This project demonstrates the ability to manage changing data structures in ETL workflows effectively.
